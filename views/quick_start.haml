          Add the Core Data framework to your project.
        %ol
          %li
            Right click on "Frameworks", select "Add / Existing Frameworks...", and choose Core Data.
          %li
            Import CoreData.h in your prefix file:
            %pre
              %code
                \#import &lt;CoreData/CoreData.h&gt;
            %aside
              Tip: your prefix file is a header that is automatically included by every class. It is usually named something like
              ProjectName_Prefix.pch. If you don't have one, you can create one and then set "Prefix Header" in your target build settings.
          %li
            Create a Core Data model file. You can find the file type in "Add / New File... / iPhone OS / Resource / Data Model". The extension of
            the file should be .xcdatamodel.
  
    %li.main
      %div
        %h3
          Add Core Resource and its dependencies to your project.
        %p
          Core resource does not yet have a framework target, so you should just copy all of its files into your project folder.
        %p
          %ol
            %li
              Drag the CoreResource folder into your project (into "Classes", for example). 
            %li
              Make sure "Copy items into destination group's folder" and "Recursively create groups for any added folders" are checked.
            %li
              Right click on the "Examples" folder and remove it
